# Ice House Acadmecy Curriculum

Welcome to the Ice House Academy's curriculum repository! 

This repo contains beginner and intermediate lessons for learning Android and iOS development. Each lesson contains a markdown file containing an introduction to the topic, guided coding lessons, and additional reading and exercises to try on your own. Additionally, there is a code folder that contains the source code for each lesson. We encourage you to try writing the code on your own first, and reference the finished code if you get stuck.
